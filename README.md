Title Tag Based Boolean Web Search Engine
======================
This program parses the web pages reachable from the seed web page given as input and index their title tag content and use this information to give the result for particular query.Boolean OR search is used to give the the set of URLs as a result.I wrote this program to understand how search engines like Google, Bing work.You can modify to index the whole content of webpage instead of just title tag content.Search is completely different from what commercial search engines use.They generally use probabilistic models,user feedback and lots of other stuffs to give good results.


How To Run This Program
=========================
There are two files,
WebCrawler.java: This is file contains the code for crawler.Run it first.
Client.java:This is the file which takes queries and returns the set of URLs.
